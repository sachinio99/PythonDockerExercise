# ploomber-test

*Important: please keep all this content confidential.*

Pre-requisites:

- [`miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (you can use a different environment manager if you prefer)
- [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A GitHub account 

This project implements a command line interface to extract code snippets from a
markdown file and execute them. Your job is to fix some bugs and implement
Docker-based execution (more details below).

## TO DO

Write a script that allows executing the Python snippets in a `.md` with any given
Python version. The script should take the path of the `.md` file to run and
the Python version to use. Execution must be done in a Docker container.

```sh
python run-with-version.py examples/print-python-version.md --version 3.10
python run-with-version.py examples/print-python-version.md --version 3.11
```

## Evaluation criteria

- Funcionality (does the code perform the expected task?)
- Code quality (is the code easy to read?)
- User experience (how easy it is for someone completely new to use this?)
- Time (how long did you take to get a working solution?)

**Note:** They're all equally important, so don't ignore them!

## Guidelines

- Each code chunk should have access to previously defined variables (e.g., `print(x)` in chunk 2 should work if chunk 1 has `x = 1`, see [`examples/print-python-version.md`](examples/print-python-version.md) for an example)
- You can use any docker image you want (even public ones)
- You can assume the `python run-with-version.py` command will be executed in the root folder of this project
- The script should spin up and shut down the container, do not assume a container is already running
- For a good user experience consider adding documentation, validate user input, and display clear error messages

## Tips

You can use the [Docker SDK for Python](https://github.com/docker/docker-py) or call the `docker` CLI via a subprocess.

You can run `python -m build` (this uses the [`build`](https://github.com/pypa/build) package, which you can install via `pip install build`) to generate a tarball of this project. Then, you can install the project as a Python package with:

```sh
pip install path/to/tarball.tar.gz
```

It is *not mandatory* to use `conda` inside the Docker container, you can use any Python package manager like (e.g., `pip`)

## Extra

If you have time, you can work on these items:

- Add unit tests for `python run-with-version.py`
- Fix the test `test_runner_sqlite`
- When a `.md` has errors, the output is hard to read (try running `ploomber-test run examples/fail.md`). Improve the output so it is more readable and user can easily find what's the problem
- Add support for running bash snippets (only Python and SQL are implemented)

## Installation

*Note: If you have issues with the installation, or you prefer to use another environment manager (instead of conda), see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.*

```sh
pip install invoke

# this will create a conda environment, install ploomber_test as a package
# and install all required dependencies to run the code
invoke setup
```

## Testing

```sh
# ensure you activate the environment
conda activate ploomber-test

# run tests
pytest
```

If all is working correctly, you'll see something like this:

```
================================= test session starts ==================================
platform darwin -- Python 3.10.12, pytest-7.4.0, pluggy-1.2.0
rootdir: /Users/eduardo/dev/take-home-test

tests/test_parse.py ...                                                          [ 25%]

======================= 11 passed, 1 xfailed, 1 xpassed in 6.56s =======================
```

The CLI should work now:

```sh
# ensure you activate the environment
conda activate ploomber-test

ploomber-test --help
```

```
Usage: ploomber-test [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  run
```

You can run some examples:

```sh
ploomber-test run examples/print-python-version.md

ploomber-test run examples/sql-query.md
```

`ploomber-test` will run the `.md` file in the current environment, you can use this
as a starting point to build your solution (which should run the code in a Docker
container).


## Editing the code

The `invoke setup` command sets up your environment, so you should now be ready to
code.

To verify that everything is working correctly, you can run the following command:

```sh
python -c "import ploomber_test; print(ploomber_test)"
```

You should see something like this:

```
<module 'ploomber_test' from '/path/to/take-home-test/src/ploomber_test/__init__.py'>
```

Where `/path/to/take-home-test/` is the directory where this code is located.

Try making a change to `cli.py`:

```python
@click.group()
def cli():
    print("hello from cli!") # add this
```

Then, run one of the examples:

```sh
ploomber-test run examples/print-python-version.md
```

You should see that your changes are reflected:

```
hello from cli!
Running: {'code': 'import sys\nprint(sys.version)', 'language': 'python'}
3.10.12 (main, Jul  5 2023, 15:02:25) [Clang 14.0.6 ]
Output: None
Running: {'code': '1 + 1', 'language': 'python'}
Out[1]: 2
Output: 2
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with the `invoke setup` command, you can follow these steps:

```sh
# create a new conda environment (you can also use any other virtual environment tool
# like venv or virtualenv)
conda create --name ploomber-test python=3.10 --yes

# activate environment
conda activate ploomber-test

# install project in editable mode (run this from the root directory as this command
# will look for the setup.py file)
pip install --editable ".[dev]"
```

To verify the installation:

```sh
# run unit tests
pytest

# run an example using the CLI
ploomber-test run examples/print-python-version.md

# check the package was correctly installed in editable mode
python -c "import ploomber_test; print(ploomber_test)"
# should print something like:
# <module 'ploomber_test' from '/path/to/take-home-test/src/ploomber_test/__init__.py'>
```
